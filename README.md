# ðŸŒ… ISEKAI

ISEKAI is a PHP sockpuppeting service made by @reinhart1010 for @1010bots. It is intended to help and support our automated engagement and content delivery process across our fediverse instance at https://bots.reinhart1010.id.

ISEKAI is part of Project Wonderland, a large-scale fediverse-bound automation and sockpuppeting project made out of these core components:

+ ðŸŒ… **ISEKAI**, our content delivery strategy server,
+ ðŸŒŒ **KWANGYA**, our largest content idea database and aggregation service,
+ ðŸŒƒ **NIVALIS**, our bot interaction handler and staging service, and
+ ðŸŽª **SMÃ…LAND**, a simple content creation app for ISEKAI and KWANGYA.

ISEKAI stands on the frontline of our automated communication subsystems, with the ability to manage multiple account credentials, content scheduling, account selection to help increase our overall engagement. ISEKAI also learns from interaction and reaction patterns between these automated posts, to allow ourselves, men and machines, to improve our communication skills across the cyberspace.
